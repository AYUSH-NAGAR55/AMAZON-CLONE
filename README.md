# AMAZON-CLONE
This project is a static clone of the Amazon homepage, built entirely using HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the layout, structure, and visual styling of the original site without using any JavaScript. The goal was to practice clean markup, modular CSS, and responsive design principles while recreating a familiar interface.
